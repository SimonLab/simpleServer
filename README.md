## What is THUD?
THUD is a mobile device that records sound and vibration levels at construction sites. The device receives data from the various sensors (i.e. Sound, accelerometer, piezo vibration) and the application manages the operation of those sensors, collects analytics, and reports the data in the cloud. 

## Why
1.3 million people in the UK are affected by noise pollution. Construction sites, pubs, clubs, transport hubs, entertainment venues, traffic, and noisy neighbors. There is a health link between loud noise and permanent hearing loss, such as tinnitus 

## Isn't there already a solution in place?
The United Kingdom's current solution deals with noise pollution on a wider scale. They track the noise pollutants using sound immission contour maps. These are great to see what a city's noise pollution is like but not for a specific time or exact location. 

## How is it different?
THUD deals with a specific instance of noise pollution. It shows where and when noise exceeds the acceptable level and will allow residents to pinpoint when there is a suitable case for a noise complaint. 

## How does it work?
THUD works by recording the data using Intel's Edison Board. The information is sent to Hapi servers and then displayed using Chart JS.
