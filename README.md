# FAQ

Have a look at ES6! Ask @rafe for more details

- What is eslint?

It allow you keep some convention in your code. You should ask @rafe for more explantion!

- Should I use some pre-commit hook with ES6

Yes absolutly, ask @rafe to help you to configure the hooks!

- I haven't read the documentation of Hapi (It's Monday and I'm too tired) and I don't understand anything

No worries @rafe is here to help understand everything, ask him any questions!

- What are Monoid and what is the difference with Monads?

Nice question, I see you are interested in functional programing! @rafe loves FP and he can teach you how to code with Haskell in 1/2h (forget javascript)
